# Simulated-Annealing-implementation-for-Hardware-Software-Partitioning-of-PSoC
This is a C++ implementation of partitioning of Hardware and Software components of a FFT in PSoC.
The hardware components are those which make use of the MAC module in PSoC.
The MAC uses less clock cycles at the cost of an additional hardware block.
The simulated annealing algorithms finds the near best solution to partition the hardware and software blocks.
